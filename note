The CIA triad is a cybersecurity model that stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. It's a common model that's used to develop security systems and guide organizations in protecting their sensitive information and systems. The CIA triad is a foundational concept in many cybersecurity education models and is essential for cybersecurity experts to learn. 
The three pillars of the CIA triad are: 
Confidentiality
----------------------
Ensuring that authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure are preserved, including protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.
This involves controlling access to information to prevent unauthorized sharing, whether intentional or accidental. 
Integrity
-------------------------
Ensuring that data is trustworthy and free from tampering, and that it's authentic, accurate, and reliable. 
This involves guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and ensuring information non-repudiation. 
Availability
---------------------
Ensuring that information is accessible and usable in a timely and reliable manner. This can include deploying redundant systems, such as multiple servers or backup power sources, to ensure that systems can continue to operate if one fails. 
It can also include using load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple systems, and regularly testing and maintaining systems to identify and address potential issues. 

Intro
1.Cybersecurity => It is the collective methods,technologies,and processes that protect computer systems,networks,and the information they contain.
It is the practise of protecting computer networks,devices and information from damage,loss or unauthorized access.
Protects digital information  from cyberthreats.(preserves CIA)

Categories:
=>Critical Infrastructure 
=>Application Security
=>Network Security
=>Cloud Security
=>IOT Security

Information Security and Information System Security
  It is the practise of protecting information.
=>Preventing
=>Detecting
=>Remediating


Principles of INfomation security
c=>Confidentiality
Data is kept confidential and private.
I=>Integrity
Data is authentic,accurabe,and free from tampering
A=>Availability
Data is available to those who need it.
---------------------------------------
DAD triac =>opposite of CIA
D=>Disclosure
Confidential data is exposed to unauthorised paties 
A=>Alteration
The tampering data cannot be prevented or the authenticity of the data cannot be determined
D=>Denial
Unauthorized agents are prevented from accessing data.

A=>Authentication
Process of identifying and verifying a person or thing
A=>Authorization
Process of controlling access to resources
A=>Accounting
Record keeping and tracing of agent activities on computer devices and networks
THREAT LANDSCAPE
==========================================
A threat landscape, also known as a threat environment, is a collection of threats in a specific context or domain.
It includes information about identified threats, risks, vulnerable assets, threat actors, and observed trends.

THREAT ACTORS OR BAD ACTORS
=====================================
People who try to steal,sabotage,or stop you from using computer systems or accessing information that you are authorized to use and that is stored on or in transit between computing devices.
Types
=====
1.Explorer => They perhaps the least nefarious of all bad actor types. 
2.Hacktivist 
3.Cyberterrorist
4.Cybercriminal
5.Cyberwarrior

Methods used by Explorer and other bad actors is Phishing
TYPES
1.SPEAR PHISHING(Through email)
2.SMISHING(Through text messages or SMS)
3.VISHING(VoIP =>VOICE-OVER-IP)

-------------------------------------------------
HACKTIVIST:
Common strategy of hactivists is to build a botnet
