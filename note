The CIA triad is a cybersecurity model that stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. It's a common model that's used to develop security systems and guide organizations in protecting their sensitive information and systems. The CIA triad is a foundational concept in many cybersecurity education models and is essential for cybersecurity experts to learn. 
The three pillars of the CIA triad are: 
Confidentiality
----------------------
Ensuring that authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure are preserved, including protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.
This involves controlling access to information to prevent unauthorized sharing, whether intentional or accidental. 
Integrity
-------------------------
Ensuring that data is trustworthy and free from tampering, and that it's authentic, accurate, and reliable. 
This involves guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and ensuring information non-repudiation. 
Availability
---------------------
Ensuring that information is accessible and usable in a timely and reliable manner. This can include deploying redundant systems, such as multiple servers or backup power sources, to ensure that systems can continue to operate if one fails. 
It can also include using load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple systems, and regularly testing and maintaining systems to identify and address potential issues.
